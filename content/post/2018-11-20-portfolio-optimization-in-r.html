<h1>Project Summary</h1>
<p>I’ve always wanted to build out some tools to start managing my portfolio. I was recently inspired by Matt Dancho @ <a href="https://business-science.io">business-science.io</a>, an author of the tidyquant package, who wrote an article describing his initial interest in R for investment portfolio optimization and his quick success at quickly turning around his performance through quantitative analytics. Now that he’s written <a href="https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/">tidyquant</a>, financial analysis and portfolio optimization is much more user friendly, so I thought I’d give it a go.</p>

<p>I have a shiny application that’s currently in development (as of Nov-2018), which implements a narrow optimization strategy that’s suited for my needs. I’m hoping to find time to build it out to handle more generalized needs in the near future. Check it out!</p>
