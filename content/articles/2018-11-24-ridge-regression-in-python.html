<p><img src="/articles/2018-11-24-ridge-regression-in-python_files/RidgeRegression.png#floatleft" alt="Ridge Regression" type="left" width="300" height="300" /> Ridge Regression is a hyper-parameter tuning technique that helps us deal with multi-collinearity and variance in regression models. Here, we use cross-validation to provide a robust OLS estimation with variance taken into account. This allows us to have the benefits of polynomial regression (low bias), while penalizing high-variance to find a balanced model that has a good fit, but generalizes well to new data.</p>
