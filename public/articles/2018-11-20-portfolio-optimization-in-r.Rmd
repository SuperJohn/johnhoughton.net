# Project Summary
I've always wanted to build out some tools to start managing my portfolio. I was recently inspired by Matt Dancho @ [business-science.io](https://business-science.io), an author of the tidyquant package, who wrote an article describing his initial interest in R for investment portfolio optimization and his quick success at quickly turning around his performance through quantitative analytics. Now that he's written [tidyquant](https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/), financial analysis and portfolio optimization is much more user friendly, so I thought I'd give it a go. 

## Shiny App

I have a shiny application that's currently in development (as of Nov-2018), which implements a narrow optimization strategy that's suited for my needs. I'm hoping to find time to build it out to handle more generalized needs in the near future. Check it out! 

Here's a Link to my app on shinyapps.io:
