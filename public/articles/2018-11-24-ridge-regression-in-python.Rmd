Ridge Regression is a hyper-parameter tuning technique that helps us deal with multi-collinearity and variance in regression models. Here, we use cross-validation to provide a robust OLS estimation with variance taken into account. This allows us to have the benefits of polynomial regression (low bias), while penalizing high-variance to find a balanced model that has a good fit, but generalizes well to new data.
