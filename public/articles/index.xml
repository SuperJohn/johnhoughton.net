      <description>Ridge Regression is a hyper-parameter tuning technique that helps us deal with multi-collinearity and variance in regression models. Here, we use cross-validation to provide a robust OLS estimation with variance taken into account. This allows us to have the benefits of polynomial regression (low bias), while penalizing high-variance to find a balanced model that has a good fit, but generalizes well to new data.

      <description>Project Summary I’ve always wanted to build out some tools to start managing my portfolio.

Now that he’s written tidyquant, financial analysis and portfolio optimization is much more user friendly, so I thought I’d give it a go.</description>
